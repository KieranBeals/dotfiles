I was looking at [MrSom3body's dotfiles](https://github.com/MrSom3body/dotfiles) and **loved** how they organized everything.

This is my attempt at understanding and using the [dendritic](https://github.com/mightyiam/dendritic) pattern.

Poseidon -> Desktop
Hephaestus -> Framework 13

# Credits
Just like [MrSom3body](https://github.com/MrSom3body), I have drawn inspiration and code frome some of these sources:

- [The Dendritic Pattern](https://github.com/mightiam/dendritic)
- [MrSom3body's dotfiles](https://github.com/MrSom3body/dotfiles)  (shamelessly copied most of the nix stuff from him)
- [Sudhboi's vertical waybar configuration](https://github.com/Sudhboi/niri-rice-dotfiles)
- and many many more...

# Recreation
If you want to have a nix configuration like this I would highly recommend cloning my [first commit](https://github.com/KieranBeals/dotfiles/tree/7c56528815d872fabdc598700e737a75149c4f6a) (as it has less bloat) and read through and change things to your liking. Once you have a working system, thanks to the incredibly modular [dendritic](https://github.com/mightyiam/dendritic) pattern, you can easly take and adapt any other file in my current repository to fit your own environment.
