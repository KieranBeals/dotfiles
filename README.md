I was looking at [MrSom3body's dotfiles](https://github.com/MrSom3body/dotfiles) and **loved** how they organized everything.

This is my attempt at understanding and using the [dendritic](https://github.com/mightyiam/dendritic) pattern.

Just like [MrSom3body](https://github.com/MrSom3body), I have drawn inspiration and code frome some of these sources:

- [The Dendritic Pattern](https://github.com/mightiam/dendritic)
- [MrSom3body's dotfiles](https://github.com/MrSom3body/dotfiles)  (shamelessly copied most of the nix stuff from him)
- [Sudhboi's vertical waybar configuration](https://github.com/Sudhboi/niri-rice-dotfiles)
- and many many more...
